# whitepaper
Aletheia:
Aletheia is a decentralised open access scientific journal. Think of it as a peer to peer (P2P) publishing platform and database. You can submit original scientific research or existing non copywrited research to help build up our library, and you can access our library to download articles, all free of charge.

Repository:
The multiple drafts of the whitepaper and any additional documents will be stored here. This will be maintained by Kade Morton as he continues to update the whitepaper and any other documentation.
