## Introduction
Aletheia is a decentralised, open source, open access scientific journal. It is a free client that runs on Windows, Mac and Linux, that allows the user to upload academic papers and datasets, as well as search for academic papers and datasets. The Aletheia client enforces sharing of documents with other uses also running the Aletheia client, forming a peer to peer network. Hashes of documents, metadata for documents, reputation accrued by documents, actions of users and community decisions are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. The community administers Aletheia through a community management framework of smart contracts. Aletheia is a free open source platform that allows users to share and access scientific information without being hindered by paywalls. It encourages peer review and creates its own reputation ecosystem to provide an alternative to the current prestige system that dominates academic publishing with detrimental consequences. Information is stored on the blockchain to allow version control of documents and provide resiliency to the information in the network. Aletheia allows individuals to have a say in the future of the platform and allows the community to administer the platform through direct democracy.

## Why is Aletheia important?
It was estimated in 2010 that roughly 50 million scientific articles had been published to date [1](http://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/19577/2/Jinha_Arif_2010_Article_50_million.pdf). It is unclear what percentage of scientific articles are behind paywalls but given a cursory search for scientific articles online will more often than not lead to a paywall, it can be surmised that a large percentage of scientific articles are behind paywalls. That is to say, a large percentage of humanity’s collective knowledge is only accessible by those with financial means. To put the term ‘financial means’ in context, in 2012 the Harvard Library published a letter stating that it was paying close to $3,750,000 USD a year in journal subscriptions and that this state of affairs was financially untenable, meaning the library planned on cutting back the number of journals on offer to students [2](http://gantercourses.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Faculty-Advisory-Council-Memorandum-on-Journal-Pricing-§-THE-HARVARD-LIBRARY.pdf). If Ivy League institutions cannot afford scientific journals, what chance does an institution in a developing nation, or even just your average individual have? Cutting off every person who doesn’t have the financial means to pay exorbitant fees for scientific knowledge is fundamentally wrong. Aletheia is a proposal to go some way to correcting this error while also fostering a movement against paywall journals. 

But open access already exists. Open access journals are scientific journals that do not restrict access to scientific information. While Aletheia adheres to the principles of open access it is different to existing open access journals in a number of ways. Most journals today are not in paper form and papers accessed through the journal's website that allow searching of a centralised database in the background. Aletheia is a downloadable peer to peer client, which prevents centralisation through control of the website or control of the back end database. The information stored in the Aletheia network is spread across all users running the client and the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring Aletheia is not beholden to any single interest and is controlled by the community. 

### A blockchain journal
A blockchain is a distributed ledger that through cryptographic means can only be added to, not subsequently changed. For a thorough technical explanation of a blockchain, please see Satoshi Nakamoto’s original paper, [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). Aletheia utilises a blockchain to achieve a distributed and tamper proof database of information, storing document metadata, vote topics, vote results and information specific to users such as reputation and certifications. Due to the distributed nature of the stored information, Aletheia is a decentralised application that isn't controlled by any one party, it is administed by the community.

Aletheia also allows reputation to be accrued by users and uploaded academic papers, along with the tracking of citations of papers. Aletheia creates a reputation ecosystem that can be drilled down into the show the number of papers uploaded and their quality, number of citations the paper receives, number of reviews performed and their quality, number of decisions participated in and what decision was made. This information is a comprehensive record of a users contribution to science, which is more rigorous and scientific than the prestige model of publishing in top tier journals. Publishing in top tier journals attracts prestige due to the stringent editorial and peer review process, but evidence show retraction rates for peer reviewed work is rising [3](https://theconversation.com/what-lesson-do-rising-retraction-rates-hold-for-peer-review-28823). 

### A peer to peer journal
Peer to peer file sharing is a method of file sharing where peer to peer software is run on a computer, making that computer a peer in a network of peers. This allows the computer to query other peers also running the same software, and once it has found a peer with the desired file it begins downloading a copy [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer). To facilitate the main function of Aletheia, the obtaining of scientific journals, the Aletheia client is a peer to peer file sharing client that allows the submission of academic papers and data sets for sharing through the client. Currently datasets are hard to obtain, often stored in online repositories separate from the papers themselves, one of Aletheia’s goals is to make data easier to obtain to assist with checking the veracity of articles. By downloading and running the Aletheia client you are becoming a peer in the distributed network.

### A community journal
Smart contracts are computer programs designed to execute a predefined action based on inputs. They are typically imagined as legal contracts written as programs [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract), but they can be used to create a community management framework. Smart contracts can be written to either perform one of two predefined actions, or simply to perform or not perform a predefined action based on number of votes received during a specified time frame. In this waty, the community directly administers Aletheia through direct democracy. Aletheia is also open source, allowing people to view the source, verify its security and contribute to it if desired. Because everyone has access to the code, the code can be hosted on any website for download, making Aletheia hard to censor. Due to its decentralised nature along with providing an alternative to the current prestige system and allowing the community to directly administer the platform, Aletheia contributes something currently lacking from the current open access ecosystem.

## Submitting documents to Aletheia
Once a user has installed the Aletheia client on their computer, they can upload academic papers and associated data sets to be shared with the Aletheia community. To facilitate the search function and allow the client to return papers on particular topics or from particular disciplines, metatdata is also required. This can be entered at time of submission to Aletheia, or it can be added at a later date by the community.

The metadata fields in Aletheia are based on the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set along with research author consultation:

* The contributors to the article
* Contributor identifiers, such as ORCIDs
* The date the article was published
* An abstract of the article
* The language the article is written in
* The publisher of the article if published elsewhere previously
* A list of related resources
* The source of the article’s contents
* The title of the article
* Discipline of the article, a drop down from:
  * Performing arts
  * Visual arts
  * Geography
  * History
  * Languages and literature
  * Philosophy
  * Theology
  * Anthropology
  * Economics
  * Law
  * Political science
  * Psychology
  * Sociology
  * Biology
  * Chemistry
  * Earth sciences
  * Space sciences
  * Physics
  * Computer Science
  * Mathematics
  * Statistics
  * Engineering
  * Medicine and health sciences
* Author's contributions
* Author's affiliations
* Funding body
* Keywords
* Publication date range
* Pre-Print indication

For an explanation of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set please see the [Dublin Core website](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/). Not all of these terms will be immediately clear to the average user, so they are not mandatory fields. This metadata in its current state is saved to Ethereum with a note that it has not been vetted. This block will be vetted by the community and once done so another block will be added stating that the previous block is now vetted. This forms an audit trail such that any tampering with the metadata will be clearly visible. 

Should any disagreement arise over the vetted metadata, it will be resolved through a community voting mechanism, explained later, the results of which will be again added as a new block to again add to the audit trail. Should part or all of the article be superseded, for example if an article is submitted that relies on a particular mathematical theory and the theory is proven to be incorrect, again a vote will be held and another block will be added to the chain noting the vote and the vote’s outcome with an amendment outlining the superseded information being added to the document itself and version information to show the document’s progression. The entire life cycle of the article will be clear for anyone to see. Vetting metadata will be incentivised through reputation, discussed later. 

## Acceptance into Aletheia
Before the articles become searchable and downloadable through the client, a community vote must be held and carried for the article to be accepted into Aletheia. This is to prevent things other than academic papers and related documents like data sets being uploaded and Aletheia being used as arbitrary external storage. A vote for the document to be accepted into Aletheia is launched at time of sbmission, a deliberately broad question that is a binary yes/no voute: "Do the documents represent academic research or not?". All users can see pending votes through their client, can download the documents associated with the vote to assess them and cast their vote. 

### Thresholds
A reputation threshold will be set and for a vote to pass a number of users that collectively have more than the required reputation must vote yes for the documents to be added to Alethiea. The reputation threshold for the yes vote will be higher than the no vote, deliberately biasing Alethia to make it harder for non academic content to enter Aletheia. Along with a reputation threshold a user number threshold will also need to be met, to ensure a minimum number of users vote on the inclusion of the documents. This ensures it's harder for users who have legitimately ammassed reputation to dictate what does or doesn't come into Aletheia. The final threshold will be a time threshold, votes will remain active for a set period of time, allowing enough time for both a yes or a no vote to accrue. If both yes and no votes reach their reputation and user number thresholds within the timeframe, the vote defaults to no and fails. All three thresholds, reputation, number of users and time elapsed  must be met for a vote to succeed. 

### Storage in Aletheia
If the vote passes the documents are accepted into Aletheia and will be returned in the client through search results. If the vote fails the documents will be deleted and the user notified by way of their client. Acceptance into Aletheia means a hash of the document and the document metadata are added to Ethereum and the Aletheia client will seed the document for download by other users. The hash can be checked against seeds to prevent tampering with documents and help demonstrate version control for papers. Due to current limitations with the amount of information able to be stored on a blockchain, the article itself is not stored on Ethereum. With advances in blockchain and computing it is hoped that a point can be reached where content could be stored on the blockchain itself, making the storage of articles more secure, at which point this new method would be adopted for Aletheia. 

### Voting reputation
Voting will be encentivised through reputation and further reputation will be rewarded for voting with the majority, regardless of if the vote passed or not or if the majority voted one way and the vote went the other way due to thresholds either being met or not. This means people will not be punished by the vote but they will be rewarded by following the crowd. The posed question, "Do the documents represent academic research or not?" is deliberately broad and the crowd in most instances should pick the correct outcome, therefore deliberately trying to skew votes will be punished. To prevent a malicious actor downloading a number of clients and attempting to vote, only users with a set reputation level can vote. That reputation level can be attained by the solving of a one time captcha and/or any other method of proving a user is a human as the technology around bots continues to develop.

## Peer review
To quote the paper [A multi-disciplinary perspective on emergent and future innovations in peer review](https://github.com/aletheia-foundation/aletheia-whitepaper/blob/master/Submitted-Ver-1.pdf) *"Success for any such development (of a new peer review system) relies on reaching a critical threshold of research community engagement with both the process and the platform, and therefore cannot be achieved without a significant change of incentives in research environments. A major part of this relies on research communities recognising that peer review is not a static or singular process, but a constantly evolving, and ideally improving, mechanism of quality assurance. This could greatly reduce friction to the cultural adoption of new models, and lead to a peer review process fit for a modern scholarly communication system."* It's acknowledged at the outset of building Aletheia that current academic publishing is culturally entrenched and will be hard to supplant. But to highlight the point above, *peer review is not a static or singular process, but a constantly evolving, and ideally improving, mechanism of quality assurance*, an open source platform that anyone can iterate upon is perhaps the best place for a peer review system. As such we do not expect the peer review process in Aletheia to remain static and it is therefore hard to quantify in this paper. What follows is a straightforward approach to peer review but will not definitively cover all Aletheia's final features.

Along with the vetting of metadata, the papers and data sets themselves must be vetted. A number of papers will already have undergone a peer review process or will elect to forego a peer review process, so peer review not a mandatory step for submission. The review, regardsless which chosen remains open indefinetly, and should a paper be uploaded without selecting a peer review and at a later stage the author/s wish to instigate a peer review they only need reupload the same document and select peer review at time of submission. The unreviewed paper will we retrivable through the client once submitted and approved, and effectively exists as a preprint at this stage. For many reasons a paper that selects peer review might never receive reviews and effectively the peer review opportunity remains open indefinetly. Should the paper later receive reviews as reviews are performed a hash of the review will be stored as a new block associated with the paper, meaning as and when reviews come in they can also be retrieved through the client. Papers naturally progress from preprint to peer reviewed and the paper's reputation score increases. If the submitter requests the article be peer reviewed they can choose to either have their work peer reviewed by particular users, a short list peer review, or they can open their article up to the entire reviewer pool, an entire pool peer review.

### Short List peer review
In short list review, the submitter will be able to search for users to review their work through their client, either by name or reputation score. The reviewer can see if they have been selected for short list review through their client and can either accept or decline the review. 

### Entire Pool peer review
In an entire pool review the client will push a request to reviewers in the appropriate field and must reach three acceptances in five days or the review is cancelled. Once the review is completed and the work resubmitted the article will immediately be accepted onto the blockchain for download by normal users.

A reviewer will see through the Aletheia client all the articles they can review regardless of the peer review method and reviewing will be incentivised through reputation. The reviewer will select the article and write their notes, uploading their notes much like an article. The reviewer can reference articles already indexed on the blockchain as part of their peer review, forming a 'chain of fact' that stretches from article to article. Once finished a block will be added to the blockchain connected to the article to inform people the article has been peer reviewed and people can download the peer review notes from the reviewer should they so wish. 

Once three such blocks have been added to the blockchain the person who submitted the article will be alerted through the client that their article has come back from review, and they will download the review notes via the peer to peer file sharing
 system. They will make whatever changes required to their article and resubmit. If in the event the article is so poor, or it is not even a scientific article at all, the reviewer can immediately push the article to the next stage, a vote for acceptance to be indexed onto the blockchain.

## Cryptographic Control
One obvious vulnerability of Aletheia is that an attacker could upload a large number of articles in an attempt to overload and crash the network. A preventative mechanism must be implemented to prevent such an attack, and the mechanism that has been designed is called a crypto control. A control is a cryptographic resource issued to users that allow them to upload documents to the network. It is abundant enough that a normal user would not notice the control, but places an upper limit on how many documents can be uploaded per user in a twenty four hour period. The control will be tied to interaction with the network, downloading articles, participating in votes, peer review etc., along with a natural amount that accrues over time that will decay if not used. The decay prevents an attacker registering 'sleeper' accounts to attack the network at some point in future. The control for Aletheia has been dubbed Veris, derived from the word verisimilitude, meaning the appearance or semblance of truth, likelihood or probability. The amount of Veris a user has will determine how many documents they can be upload to Aletheia. 

## The rights to content shared via Aletheia and takedown orders
Currently there are simpler models for making scientific articles available to people, such as simply hosting previously peer reviewed articles regardless of rights or legality and offering them to anyone through their browser, much like a search engine. In effect this is pirating scientific articles. [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.bz/) is the most prominent example of these pirated article search engines. Aletheia recognises what Sci-Hub does as illegal as it violates the laws of many jurisdictions, however Sci-Hub shares exactly the same motivations as Aletheia, the removal of paywalls and making scientific knowledge available to everyone. But due to the fact that Sci-Hub and its ilk are illegal, this opens the door to the argument that what they do is immoral simply because it is breaking the law. 

This is a powerful argument leveraged by paywall
 publishers, despite the fact that the morality of the laws themselves, or the morality of profiting from denying people knowledge, put another way, fostering ignorance and limiting the progress of the human race, is never put under scrutiny. Due to their illegal nature, Sci-Hub and others face challenges, like having their websites taken down periodically and having criminal and civil charges being brought against those administering these sites. At the time of writing, Alexandra Elbakyan, the creator of Sci-Hub, is wanted for extradition to the United States over charges of piracy [5](https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sci-hub.pdf).

Aletheia has been designed to comply with anti-piracy laws to remove the moral argument from paywall journals against open access. Aletheia is therefore a deliberate attempt to advance the argument against paywalls in a direction that it has not gone very far in previously, creating an alternative to paywall journals that cannot have an immorality argument levelled against it on the basis of being illegal. Content that has not been published elsewhere that is submitted to Aletheia is offered under a _Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence_. By publishing through Aletheia you certify that you have permission to publish the submitted content or that the article is already in the public domain. Content that has been published elsewhere and therefore will have rights attached to it can still be published through Aletheia as long as it is legal to do so. Again, the user certifies as part of the upload that they are not breaching existing rights by doing so. In the event where rights of work are ambiguous, such as orphan works,  Aletheia offers the work under _Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence_ until such time as the existing rights become clear and to continue to host the article would breach these rights. Despite having an identity management system, discussed later, it is clear that under the above system it is possible for someone to submit work in violation of existing rights. 

In a perfect world a system could be built with checks such that it is impossible for someone to upload work to a system like Aletheia illegally, allowing the content that Aletheia offers to never diminish. Indeed, this is one of the main points of a blockchain. Unfortunately this isn’t a perfect world and Aletheia needs to have a mechanism in place to remove content from the blockchain to avoid running afoul of legal action, or simply to remove content that doesn’t belong on the blockchain. Aletheia takes no responsibility for the actions of users, but will comply with takedown orders in the event the takedown order is found to be valid. In the event Aletheia receives a takedown order a notification will be sent to the community through the Aletheia client. A vote will be held on the veracity of the takedown order and if a quorum defined by the level of active users is achieved, a block will be added to the chain against the document preventing it from being shared. The document will be searchable by the client, however will no longer download through the client. 

Instead, a document will be created and users will be asked through the client if they would like to host and seed this notice. The notice will appear in search results for that document and will be downloadable. It will  state who the takedown request came from. In the event the content taken down was forced through the checks and was not a scientific article, the notice will state as such. If the takedown request was not for rights violations, but for other reasons, such as the content contained personal information and by making it public this breeched the person’s privacy, for example, the notice will state as such. However, if the notice is for rights violation, the notice will state something yet to be decided upon but in the spirit of the below:

_Article [insert name here] has been removed from Aletheia as the Aletheia community has received a takedown order from [insert name here] and found the order to be valid in its assertion that rights to the work have been violated._

_Scientific knowledge should be free for all though, and [insert name here] just deprived you of knowledge. What’s worse, [insert name here] did this legally. While Aletheia complies with the law, we don’t believe all laws are moral and some should be changed. Certain practices, like paywalls, stunt the growth of humanity simply to line the pockets of a select few. Did you know that [insert name here] posted a profit of [insert value here] in [insert year here]?_

_Laws that benefit very powerful vested interests will only be changed if pressure is bought to bare. Things you can do to help add to this pressure while remaining within the confines of the law:_

_Boycott paywalls of all kinds. Do not give them money, hit them where it hurts.
Call or write to your local, state and federal government representatives expressing that [insert name here] is operating in a legal but unethical manner, and the changing of laws
 that allow these immoral practices to occur legally is an important issue to you and your vote come election time.
Call or write to your local educational institutions and express that [insert name here] is operating in a legal but unethical manner, and the educational institution should join you in boycotting them. Suggest the educational institution source articles from open source journals and that this decision will be an important factor in deciding where your future tuition fees are invested.
Pitch news stories to your local media representatives about the legal but immoral practices [insert name here] engage in._

_You may be able to find the article you are looking for on websites such as Sci-Hub, this is simply a fact, much like saying water is wet, and we do not encourage you to find your article there. Piracy is illegal._

A notice like this adequately expresses Aletheia’s position while not breaching the law. In an effort to prevent abuse of articles being removed from searches of the blockchain, such as if an attacker submitted a takedown order and then performed a majority attack on the subsequent vote, a vote can be held at any time to make the article downloadable again. If such a vote succeeds, another block would be added to the chain indicating the document is again searchable and downloadable.

At this stage it is not planned to introduce a method where the Aletheia blockchain could be forked, though it is recognised that unforeseen circumstances do arise. Should such a circumstance present itself, the question of forking would be put to the community as a vote.

## Access and identity management *** This section is under review as we have received a number of comments around vetting peer reviewers and are currently seeking the best way to do this***
As identity is an integral part of Aletheia an identity management system is required. It’s important to note that your identity on Aletheia need not be connected to your real world identity if you so choose. Upon downloading the Aletheia client you will be asked to set up an account accessible by a username and password. The username and password will be encrypted and stored locally on the users device. It's a design principle of Aletheia to centrally hold and host as little information as possible, meaning a single server breach by attackers does not compromise the entire network, a single disaster or external act does not threaten the network, and as an entity Aletheia cannot hand over user records if subpoenaed because no records exist. A public and private PGP key pair will be generated with each account as well, which will also be encrypted and stored locally. This key will be used to prove that certain actions, such as the submission of documents or the auditing of source code was conducted from a particular account. You will also be able to associate an ORCID with your account if you have one. When you submit papers you can choose to if you are the author/one of the authors and your ORCID will prefill in the metadata section.

Should you wish to peer review documents you can have your qualifications verified. Much as a user upload scientific articles, a user can submit scanned copies of any qualification, such as a degree from a university, and sign the documents with the private PGP key unique to the user’s account. These documents are associated with that specific account, hosted and seeded by the user and anyone on the network can download and view the qualifications. To become accepted as a peer reviewer your qualifications will need to be established as legitimate. This will involved either paid staff or skilled volunteers making contact with the educational institution the qualifications come from to establish they indeed issued the qualifications to the person the user claims to be. As a one time only, you will need to submit a photographic identity document that can be seen by the user conducting the verification and at the end of the review process the identity document will be purged from the system. As at this stage only metadata is permanently stored to the blockchain the identity document can be purged. 

Should Aletheia move to storing content on the blockchain in future, the identity document would be submitted some other way. Please note that the qualification is not purged, it remains on record and viewable, so becoming a peer reviewer ties the users Aletheia account to their real identity, something to bear in mind. The reviewer will countersign the qualification with their own private PGP key, and the user's client will update, granting them the ability to see articles submitted for peer review.

## The incentivised seeding problem
An often cited issue with peer to peer technology is that
 few people seed purely for the benefit of the peer to peer network. Some networks will hamper people who don't seed at all, called leeches, that take from the network without giving back, but there is rarely an incentive for people to seed past altruism to the network itself. What is also often seen in such networks is that only popular content is seeded, that's the content that most people have so therefore that's the content that most people can in turn get. This marginalises less popular content that might have just as much intrinsic worth. There has been a great deal of study around the behavioural economics of peer to peer networks, but the approach Aletheia will take is a simple one. The health of the network is vital for Aletheia's success and all content must be shared equally, therefore Aletheia will enforce seeding. When a user downloads the client they are agreeing to run a node that will seed and this will be made explicitly clear. The node chooses what content will be seeded, ensuring there will always be content available to all users and all of the content will be equally accessible.

## Community
Aletheia is the embodiment of software that, while it exists as code, it does not function in any real sense out of human context. Aletheia’s skeleton may be a blockchain, but it’s heart is the human community. Anyone, by downloading the Aletheia client and setting up a profile, can be a member of the community and through the client the user will be able to see all the activities they can take part in as a member of the community. 

Below is a basic guide to the common community activities:

* Peer review documents – Users that have their qualifications verified are able to see documents pending peer review. They will be able to download the documents and send them back to the submitter to assess their feedback.

* Vet peer reviewers – look over submitted identity documents to ensure the user has the qualification they claim.

* Localise documents – translate documents into other languages and then host and seed the document which will be linked to the original, making Aletheia’s content more accessible to a wider audience.

* Host and seed documents – all users will see a list of suggested documents with low seed counts that they can download and seed. This strengthens Aletheia as a global network.

* Vet the metadata submitted with articles and datasets – improve the metadata quality to improve search results for articles through the Aletheia client.

* Participate in votes – decisions that smart contracts cannot handle themselves are given over to the global community to vote on. For a vote to pass a quorum must be reached, determined by the number of active users. Often the topic being voted upon is not black and white and discussions need to be held. Clicking on the vote notification in the client will bring up a screen asking you for your vote along with providing a link to a forum were discussions can be held. It's envisaged the most common vote will be for content to be indexed to the blockchain, but other votes such as on the legitimacy of takedown orders will also be held. The length of a vote, five consecutive days, cannot be changed. However, in a situation where new information comes to light and more time is required for deliberation before a vote is decided, the originator of the vote can cancel the initial vote and restart the vote at a later time. Similarly the size of the required quorum for a vote to pass cannot be changed and is worked out at the time the vote is established by the number of active users. Should there be a drastic drop in the number of users for whatever reason and the quorum simply cannot be reached, the vote can be cancelled by the originator and restarted with a new quorum taking into account the current users. To prevent votes simply being reset because the originator doesn't like the perceived outcome, the results of the vote cannot be seen until after the vote has ended. All users can see is the number of users who have voted, not which way they have voted.

* Participate in online forums – Not all votes are simple and many will need to be discussed in an online forum. In the same spirit as a blockchain, forum posts cannot be edited. Every twenty four hours the forum generates a document containing text of new threads and posts created in the last twenty four hours, this document is added to the blockchain as per a scientific article without any vetting process, and people are encouraged to host and seed the document. Should the website hosting the forum ever be attacked or taken down for any reason, a distributed copy exists to recreate the forum.

* Audit source code – by auditing source code, signing the section of code along with the auditor's comments with their PGP private key and hosting and seeding the generated audit document users can contribute to the security of Aletheia.

## Reputation system
The often cited reason existing open source journals don't grow to rival their paywall counterparts is due to the prestige that comes with being published in a large, well established paywall journal. For academics it is often more beneficial for their careers to publish in a large paywall journal [6](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/09/nobel-winner-boycott-science-journals). Aletheia
 can do nothing about the prestige academics get for publishing in paywall journals other than to work to inform people about the negative aspects of paywall journals, but Aletheia can attempt to emulate this prestige to encourage submissions. Interacting with the community and contributing to Aletheia will gain reputation, a record of which is stored on an immutable blockchain. Anything from hosting and seeding documents to participating in votes and peer reviews will gain a user reputation in that field with an aggregated overall reputation score. Given all the tasks required to generate reputation along with the checks built into many of the processes, plus the trusted nature of the blockchain over a mundane website it is hoped that Aletheia reputation could come to mean something outside of Aletheia. 

To make the reputation system more than just numbers inside of Aletheia, the higher the user's reputation the more weight their vote carries. To prevent an adversary obtaining a large amount of reputation for the purpose of influencing votes, such as hosting and seeding a large number of documents already indexed to the blockchain, the weight of votes will be calculated by assessing reputation in all areas and screening out extreme outliers. A normal user will more than likely participate in multiple activities on Aletheia, even if this is just voting and participating in the forums, but this means there is no immediate way for an attacker to gain a large amount of reputation for little effort. Similarly a user can download multiple clients to attempt to gain multiple votes, but the votes will carry little weight without reputation. Such an attacker could gain reputation by performing tasks across a number of clients, but the collective reputation will be the same as if they had performed these actions from the one client with the one 'heavier' vote rather than multiple 'lighter' votes.

### What reputation will be scored on
The below is a work in progress list of the different things that will increase the reputation of a user:

* Submitting scientific research papers
* Peer reviewing the papers of others
* The inclusion of data sets with papers so data sets are stored together with papers, easily locatable and not lost.
* The inclusion of data analysis methodology so research is easily reproducible
* Participating in community voting
* Discussing votes in community forums
* Hosting and seeding documents, depending on implementation 

## Code audit ***This section is under review as is long term planning and may be broken out into its own project***
Linus's Law and the Many Eyes Theory suggest that bugs in open source software should be shallow due to the number of eyes looking at the code [7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's_Law), [8](http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/09/many-eyes-theory-conclusively-disproven.html). However, discoveries of vulnerabilities like Shellshock in open source code that has been available for people to look at for roughly twenty five years calls these theories into question. In current open source projects it's not often easy to see how much of the code has actually been audited and therefore it's very easy for some to make the sweeping statement 'the code is open source so it must have very few to no bugs'. Aletheia attempts to shine a light on code auditing. Anyone can view the source code for Aletheia and therefore anyone can audit the code. Users can create a document with sections of source code they have audited along with notes of conditions if met the code will be secure under etc., and sign this document with their private PGP key. This document can then be hosted and seeded, and the weight of the audit can be verified by the reputation of the user. Based on this data Aletheia can show all users exactly how much of the code base has been audited, by which users, by how many users and how much weight should be placed in the audit. 

To encourage code audits, users can become certified auditors much the same way users are vetted to become peer reviewers. If the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment on successful completion of the task once the community verifies by a vote that the audit is legitimate.

## Smart contracts
The mechanism that Aletheia handles votes and other decisions is through smart contracts. These smart contracts can be broadly thought of in two categories, votes related to the blockchain and management of Aletheia. 

Smart contracts handling
 votes related to the blockchain:

* Acceptance to be indexed onto the blockchain – should the metadata of the article and dataset be searchable by the Aletheia client.

* Confirmation that a peer review was legitimate – after the article is indexed on the blockchain a vote will be held to assess the peer review to ensure it actually took place and that it is sufficient. If the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment if the vote is carried.

* Confirmation that a code audit was legitimate – on the hosting and seeding of a code audit document by a certified user a vote will be held to ensure the audit is legitimate. If the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment if the vote is carried. 

* Disagreement with acceptance to be indexed by the blockchain – If something that is not a scientific article or dataset makes it past the previous check a vote can be held to make it unsearchable by the client, thereby removing it from circulation through Aletheia.

* Vetting localisation – for a translated document be accepted onto the blockchain it will need to be approved  by someone who affirms they also speak this language. There will be a list of languages that users can click on to drill down into the pending translations and the approver will sign the document with their pgp key asserting the translation is of good quality. 

* Superseded/incorrect information – should an article be found to be partially or wholly factually incorrect, possibly due to an advancement in scientific understanding or any other means, a vote can be held to add a notation to the article stating as such.

* Disagreement with a translation – should a user feel a translated document is of poor quality or completely incorrect, a vote can be launched to remove the document from the blockchain. In this instance vote with a  quorum will be set based off the number of active users submitting translations.

* Disagreement with vetting of users – should a user have reason to believe a previously accepted peer reviewer does not hold or no longer holds the qualifications that allowed them to become a peer reviewer, a vote can be held to revoke the user's access to the peer review queue.

* Acceptance of legitimacy of a takedown order – If Aletheia receives takedown orders, to ensure the order is legitimate the order will be made available to all users to look at. Assessment of the order is a simple series of questions, does Aletheia host the document the order pertains to and was the order issued by a party that legitimately holds the rights to that document.

* Disagreement with a previously accepted takedown order – if information comes to light that a takedown order was spurious, or if the party who issued the takedown order no longer holds the rights to the document, a vote can be held to make the document downloadable once again.

Smart contracts handling the management of Aletheia:

* Hiring paid staff or skilled volunteers – users can fill out a form listing all their skills and previous work experience. The form will be accessible by other users and people can endorse one another if they have worked together previously. Based on the quality of the candidate worked out by possessed skills, length of previous work experience and endorsements rated by the reputation of the endorser, the contract will offer a paid position to the best candidate as and when roles become available or workload demands an increase in headcount.

* Maintenance of the platform – users will have the ability to make bug reports through the client. These bugs will be routed to a pool of paid staff or skilled volunteers with the required technical skills. Based on a match of the bug to skill with workload taken into consideration the bug will be assigned to one or more appropriate users who will see the bug report in their client. The contract will keep track of assigned work to be able to assess workload. If the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment on successful completion of the task once the community verifies the bug is indeed fixed. This considered external work as the request originated from Aletheia's community, not within the entity of Aletheia itself.

* Vote to verify bug was fixed – avoids bugs being simply marked as completed without being addressed.

* Development of the platform – as per maintenance of the platform, being feature requests rather than bug reports. This is considered external work.

* Vote to verify feature is now available – as per vote to verify bug fixed, being a feature request instead of a bug report.

* Allocation of internal work – any user who is a paid staff member or skilled volunteer of Aletheia can submit a work request noting down the team the work is required from. Perhaps their team needs to do something, so the work request is submitted knowing it will come back to them simply so the contract has a record of the workload. Or perhaps a team needs something from another team before they can press on with a task, they can submit a work request that will be routed to the required team. The contract will allocate to members of the team with the best
 skills/most capacity. This workload allocation prevents the need of positions purely devoted to workload management of direct reports. This type of work is considered internal work, which needs a vote to sign off on completion from internal paid staff/skilled volunteers but not the wider community.

* Other requirements of the platform – as per maintenance of the platform, but is a catch all contract for things like legal advice, graphic design etc.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
* Payroll – at a regular interval the contract will check how much work has been completed by each staff member/skilled volunteer taking into account the difficulty of the work and a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as a regular wage along with an adjusted amount based on work signed off as completed by internal vote taking into account difficulty. 

* Budget – at a regular interval the contract will check how much money is available to the Aletheia entity. It will publish this information to the blockchain along with expenses accrued during that period such as wages of staff and payments to skilled volunteers. At the end of each year the system will publish a projection for the coming year based off data from the last year/s.

* Catch-all contract – smart contracts are meant to facilitate work, not dictate it and sometimes computer code just doesn't cover a real world situation. Rather than the normal five day period, as this contract may be invoked in the instance
 of an emergency and the vote will expire once all active staff/skilled volunteers have voted and to pass the vote must be unanimous. Any staff member/skilled volunteer can call a vote on whatever the issue happens to be. If the vote passes its agreed work will be carried out contrary to/outside of the scope of existing contracts until that particular subject is addressed. This could be used by staff/skilled volunteers to take executive action in the event enough users believes an issue threatens the existence of Aletheia itself for example. There is potential for abuse in such a contract, however the entire workforce would need to collude to use this contract maliciously, being a high bar of difficulty. It's also worth mentioning that contracts are largely just directives that people can choose to obey and ignore, so any contract could be ignored or action could be taken at any time that contradicts a contract, much as people can choose to follow or ignore etiquette rules posted in the office kitchen. Risk is not unique to this contract.

Every smart contract, along with every time it is invoked and the outcome of the execution of the smart contract is stored on the blockchain to provide a fully transparent audit trail.

## Revenue model *** This section is under review as we have sought legal advice suggesting the not for profit route may be a more feasible alternative***
Ideally the human race would be a post scarcity society and individuals wouldn't need monetary incentive because they don't have expenses in their lives. Unfortunately we are not there yet, and while many in the open source community will disagree with this decision, Aletheia as an entity is envisaged as a for profit company. The source code of Aletheia itself is open source and published under a _GNU General Public License v3.0_, meaning the code will stay open source and cannot be copyrighted by anyone, but it is planned that a for profit company would support the platform and community. This purely for pragmatic reasons, the scope of Aletheia is quite large and the likelihood a prototype will be built and maintained by people volunteering their time is small. The likelihood a prototype will be built and maintained by people being paid for their time is higher. However it's recognised that deriving revenue ethically is a difficult task, but one that must be surmounted. Currently no decision has been settled on but there are a number of ideas under discussion on top of the base of accepting charitable donations.

### Advertising
Looking at Aletheia pragmatically there is a compelling argument to solve some of the problems in advertising. Currently, advertising is seen as a shady business based around generating profiles of people without their knowledge, violating their privacy that can be used to market to users better, sold onto other companies or stored for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to subpoena as and when they desire [9](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/yahoo-wants-to-patent-billboards-that-spy-on-the-public-for-targeted-ads/). Advertising also has many other problems. Billboards are expensive and often the return on investment is hard to see [10](http://www.relevance.com/is-billboard-advertising-effective-in-2015/), newspapers are in decline [11](https://web.archive.org/web/20090320033032/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003951616), video killed the radio star [12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Killed_the_Radio_Star), broadcast television has shrinking rates due to the rise of the Internet [13](http://www.techradar.com/news/television/is-broadcast-tv-toast-1295801) and online advertisements are threatened by ad blockers [14](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/ad-blocking-software-is-on-the-rise-2015-2?r=US&IR=T). As long as the Internet is viewed through a web browser that is built to have add-ons written for it and installable in a few clicks, there will always be ad blockers. As malvertising, the practice of spreading malware through ad networks, continues to rise [15](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/25/malvertising-on-the-rise-as-cybercriminals-use-int/), so will ad blockers as security mechanisms. Aletheia attempts to address these issues.

Aletheia collects no information on its users, so Aletheia will offer a number of different versions of the client, each with an age bracket and the user self selects which client they want. This way, the user can have ads that may appeal to them in complete anonymity, and they can even pick a client in an age bracket they don't belong to if they want to to further disguise their details. Aletheia will be able to report download statistics to perspective buyers to prove the size of the audience. Almost every country on Earth has laws stating children must be educated to a certain age and levels of tertiary education will continue to raise as the middle class continue to expand in developing countries [16](http://oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/3681/An_emerging_middle_class.html). It is developing countries at largely rely on pirated scientific articles due to the fact their education institutions cannot afford to pay for exorbitant paywall journals [17](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone).
 Aletheia will have a large audience unbounded by geography, race, gender, nationality or age. The Aletheia client also exists independent of a webbrowser, meaning ads cannot be blocked in Aletheia with current browser based ad blocking technology. In short, Aletheia sets the standard in ethical advertising that doesn't track ad recipients and has access to many eyes across the world with ads that cannot be blocked. 

For advertising, Aletheia plans to use a method similar to Wikipedia. When you search for something online, Wikipedia results often appear. Wikipedia does not advertise and relies solely on search engine results. Aletheia will run a website that hosts scientific journal titles that can be web crawled and indexed into search engines. When Aletheia's website appears in a search result and is clicked in it will prompt the user to log into Aletheia or direct them to a landing page were they can download a version of the client.

### Community fundraising
In bringing people together in a community devoted to scientific information there is opportunity to leverage consensus. It would be possible, if the community feels it's a worthy idea, for the Aletheia company to manage a pool of volunteer funds. Anyone can donate to the fund and rounds of community voting would be held on a regular basis for who the funds would be paid to and how much would be paid. Aletheia would in effect be a conduit to crowdfund individual research, educational institutions and anything else the community deems appropriate. Smart contracts could be written to largely automate this process and make it transparent. Aletheia would take a percentage of the funds to cover operating costs.

### Computing power
A great deal of research needs large amounts of computing power, and Aletheia would have a network that may be able to provide computing power. The implementation of this suggestion has not been explored and has only been suggested as a very high level concept, however if it is possible that Aletheia could provide computing power on demand there are many ways this could be monetised. Again, if the community desired, smart contracts and a voting mechanism could be crafted to manage such a process.

### Paid version
The final product of Aletheia has many features that will be built in stages, and then there are the inevitable bug fixes, stability patches, etc. This means there will be many versions of Aletheia. A potential revenue model is to release the minimum viable product of Aletheia for free, and when a next version is released attach a small cost to the download. Once a third version is released the second version becomes free and the third version is downloadable at a small costs. Ensuring there is always a free version of the client ensures the core principles of Aletheia are met while generating a revenue stream for future development of the platform.

### Paid peer review
Under the current paradigm, submitting your work to many paywall journals and even many open access journals costs money, in the order of tens to a few hundred dollars. This is not a small cost. However, a legitimately small cost for peer review is, in comparison, quite reasonable. It's suggested that Aletheia could charge a few dollars to handle the peer review process. Compared to spending a few hundred dollars, spending less than ten dollars for the same process is a difference so great it should not put off usage of the client.

## Why blockchain?
Aletheia does not use all the properties of a blockchain, and the idea at it's heart is simply a database. The reason a blockchain is used is primarily for its resiliency. Blockchains are resistant to tampering, meaning the information stored in a blockchain is safer than in a traditional database. Blockchains are also decentralised, meaning that anyone with the open source Aletheia client, which can be downloaded from the official website or any other place that chooses to host it, is running part of the blockchain ledger which is constantly syncing with other users to form the whole ledger. Aletheia threatens very powerful, entrenched and wealthy interests and it is expected the network could come under pressure in one way, shape or form. By using a blockchain, to take Aletheia offline an attacker would have to remove clients from a critical mass of users, or simply take a critical mass of users off the Internet, users that reside all across the world in various legal jurisdictions. Such a task is inordinately more difficult than attacking a central server.

##
 Out of scope but desirable
This whitepaper only covers the basics of Aletheia such that a working prototype can be built. There are plenty of other functions Aletheia could have so people are encouraged to participate in discussion around this project. One future feature would be a mechanism to assist researchers analyse large numbers of journals to look at publishing trends and the like in an effort to improve the publishing ecosystem. Another would be the functionality to mass download every indexed and seeded document quickly and efficiently without having to search every individual article and dataset. This final feature forms a fail-safe to Aletheia's library and allows anyone to host the documents on their own service.

## Outlook on blockchain and science
In the course of completing this whitepaper differing opinions in the scientific community on blockchain have become apparent, particularly around the peer review process. Some camps espouse a human actioned/blockchain facilitated peer review process as outlined in this paper. Others say that humans should be eliminated from the peer review process and through semantics, making human written text machine readable, a computer should check the facts in a scientific article against other submitted articles, thereby performing a ‘machine review’. Still others say that humans should be removed even from the collection of scientific fact, with large and complex Internet of Things networks generating data that can be fed into a universal 'blockchain of absolute truth'. Any misunderstanding or misrepresentation of these latter two positions is entirely unintended. This paper outlines the first of these three schools of thought, believing that perfection should not become the enemy of good. If Aletheia is successful it will certainly bring projects of the other two camps closer to realisation, so it is hoped that everyone with an interest in blockchain and/or science can support a project like Aletheia.
