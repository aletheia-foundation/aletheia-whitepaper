## Introduction
It was estimated in 2010 that roughly 50 million scientific articles had been published to date [1](http://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/19577/2/Jinha_Arif_2010_Article_50_million.pdf). It is unclear what percentage of scientific articles are behind paywalls but given a cursory search for scientific articles online will more often than not lead to a paywall, it can be surmised that a large percentage of scientific articles are behind paywalls. That is to say, a large percentage of humanity’s collective knowledge is only accessible by those with financial means. To put the term ‘financial means’ in context, in 2012 the Harvard Library published a letter stating that it was paying close to $3,750,000 USD a year in journal subscriptions and that this state of affairs was financially untenable, meaning the library planned on cutting back the number of journals on offer to students [2](http://gantercourses.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Faculty-Advisory-Council-Memorandum-on-Journal-Pricing-§-THE-HARVARD-LIBRARY.pdf). If Ivy League institutions cannot afford scientific journals, what chance does an institution in a developing nation, or even just your average individual have? Cutting off every person who doesn’t have the financial means to pay exorbitant fees for scientific knowledge is fundamentally wrong. Aletheia is a proposal to go some way to correcting this error while also fostering a movement against paywall journals. Aletheia is a blockchain that is free to access, hosting peer to peer information allowing people to transfer scientific journals to one another, with the community being facilitated by smart contracts. It is hoped these smart contracts could form the basis for administering other open source software projects.

## 2. A blockchain journal
A blockchain is a distributed ledger that through cryptographic means can only be added to, not subsequently changed. For a thorough technical explanation of a blockchain, please see Satoshi Nakamoto’s original paper, [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). A blockchain has many properties and Aletheia does not make use of them all. Aletheia isn’t concerned with creating assets and preventing double spending of those assets, for instance. Aletheia utilises a blockchain primarily to achieve a distributed and untamperable database of information, storing document metadata, vote topics, vote results and information specific to users such as reputation and certifications.

## 3. Submission and vetting
Peer to peer file sharing is a method of file sharing where you run peer to peer software on your computer, becoming a peer, that queries other computers also running the same software, other peers in the network, and once it has found a peer with the desired file it begins downloading a copy to your computer [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer). To facilitate the main function of Aletheia, the obtaining of scientific journals, the Aletheia client is a peer to peer filesharing client with some additional functionality. By downloading and running the Aletheia client you are becoming a node in the distributed blockchain. Scientific journals are tagged for filesharing through the client where you must specify the files, the scientific article and datasets to be shared, if you would like the article to be peer reviewed, and metadata. The required metadata is based off the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set:

* The contributors to the article.
* The coverage of the article.
* The creator of the article.
* The date the article was published.
* A description of the article.
* The format the file being tagged for sharing is in.
* An identifier.
* The language the article is written in.
* The publisher of the article.
* A list of related resources.
* The rights associated with the article.
* The source of the article’s contents.
* The subject of the article.
* The title of the article.
* The type of article.

For an explanation of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set please see the [Dublin Core website](http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/). Not all of these terms will be immediately clear to the average uploader, so they are not mandatory fields. This metadata in its current state is saved to the blockchain with a note that it has not been vetted. This block in the chain will be vetted, it is envisaged by staff or skilled volunteers, and once done so another block in the chain will be added stating that this is vetted information for our previous block. This forms an audit trail such that any tampering with the metadata will be clearly visible. Should any disagreement arise over the vetted metadata it will be resolved through a community voting mechanism, explained later, the results of which will be again added as a new block to the chain to again add to the audit trail. Should part or all of the article be superseded, for example if an article is submitted that relies on a particular mathematical theory and the theory is proven to be incorrect, again a vote will be held and another block will be added to the chain noting the vote and the vote’s outcome with an amendment outlining the superseded information being added to the document itself and version information to show the document’s progression. The entire life cycle of the article will be clear for anyone to see. 

It will be incentivised through reputation, discussed later, that any and all datasets the article draws on be tagged for sharing at the same time as the article. Currently datasets are hard to obtain, often stored in online repositories separate from the articles themselves and one of Aletheia’s golas is to make that data easier to obtain to assist with checking the veracity of articles. 

## 4. Peer review
Once the metadata has been vetted the article and datasets themselves must be vetted. A number of articles will already have undergone a peer review process or will elect to forego a peer review process so this step is not required in these instances. If the submitter requests the article be peer reviewed a call will go out to reviewers. Until the article has been peer reviewed and approved it won’t be downloadable through the client. Reviewers will see through the Aletheia client all the articles they can review and reviewing will be incentivised through reputation. The reviewer will select the article and write their notes, uploading their notes much like an article. The reviewer can reference articles already indexed on the blockchain as part of their peer review, forming a 'chain of fact' that stretches from article to article. Once finished a block will be added to the blockchain connected to the article to inform people the article has been peer reviewed and people can download the peer review notes from the reviewer should they so wish. Once two such blocks have been added to the blockchain the person who submitted the article will be alerted through the client that their article has come back from review, and they will download the review notes via the peer to peer file sharing system. They will make whatever changes required to their article and resubmit. If in the event the article is so poor, or it is not even a scientific article at all, the reviewer can immediately push the article to the next stage, a vote for acceptance to be indexed onto the blockchain.

To encourage peer reviewing, if the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment on successful completion of the task once the community verifies by a vote that the review was legitimate. This vote would take place after acceptance onto the blockchain so the review can be considered in the context of the whole article.

## 5. Acceptance onto the blockchain
By this point, the article has been peer reviewed either through Aletheia or by external parties, or has elected to forgo peer review. Before the articles become searchable and downloadable, a vote must be held and carried for the article to be accepted onto the blockchain. A quorum will be calculated from the number of recent logins to Aletheia. Through the Aletheia client everyone will see the votes they can participate in, and a vote for acceptance onto the blockchain is open to all users. Such a vote is based on the question “Is the article being considered scientific research?” This vote is a check to ensure Aletheia is not used as a peer to peer system for unintended items like entertainment media. If the vote meets quorum it is carried, if the vote does not meet quorum for a set period of time based on the level of active users and the number of articles currently pending acceptance, the vote is not carried and the article is not accepted. If an article is accepted a block is added to the chain indicating to the client that the article has been approved and it becomes searchable and downloadable by users through the client. A cryptographic hash of the document in its current state is generated and stored on the blockchain which can be checked against seeds to prevent tampering with documents once accepted onto the blockchain. Due to current limitations with the amount of information able to be stored on a blockchain, the article itself is not stored on the blockchain. Only the metadata for the article and the article’s history is actually stored on the blockchain. With advances in blockchain and computing it is hoped that a point can be reached where content could be stored on the blockchain itself, making the storage of articles more secure, at which point this new method would be adopted for Aletheia. Until that point a peer to peer system must be utilised. Any user of the Aletheia client will be able to search the blockchain via a search bar for key words. The client will iterate over the blocks in the chain containing article metadata and produce a list of search results. Once the user clicks on a search result the article will start downloading. Because this is a peer to peer system the articles themselves are stored on users computers, so users will be incentivised through reputation to seed articles.

## 6. The rights to content shared via Aletheia and takedown orders
Currently there are simpler models for making scientific articles available to people, such as simply hosting previously peer reviewed articles regardless of rights or legality and offering them to anyone through their browser, much like a search engine. In effect this is pirating scientific articles. [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.bz/) is the most prominent example of these pirated article search engines. Aletheia recognises what Sci-Hub does as illegal as it violates the laws of many jurisdictions, however Sci-Hub shares exactly the same motivations as Aletheia, the removal of paywalls and making scientific knowledge available to everyone. But due to the fact that Sci-Hub and its ilk are illegal, this opens the door to the argument that what they do is immoral simply because it is breaking the law. This is a powerful argument leveraged by paywall publishers, despite the fact that the morality of the laws themselves, or the morality of profiting from denying people knowledge, put another way, fostering ignorance and limiting the progress of the human race, is never put under scrutiny. Due to their illegal nature, Sci-Hub and others face challenges, like having their websites taken down periodically and having criminal and civil charges being brought against those administering these sites. At the time of writing, Alexandra Elbakyan, the creator of Sci-Hub, is wanted for extradition to the United States over charges of piracy [4](https://arstechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sci-hub.pdf).

Aletheia has been designed to comply with anti-piracy laws to remove the moral argument from paywall journals against open access. Aletheia is therefore a deliberate attempt to advance the argument against paywalls in a direction that it has not gone very far in previously, creating an alternative to paywall journals that cannot have an immorality argument levelled against it on the basis of being illegal. Content that has not been published elsewhere that is submitted to Aletheia is offered under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence. By publishing through Aletheia you certify that you have permission to publish the submitted content or that the article is already in the public domain. Content that has been published elsewhere and therefore will have rights attached to it can still be published through Aletheia as long as it is legal to do so. Again, the uploader certifies as part of the upload that they are not breaching existing rights by doing so. In the event where rights of work are ambiguous, such as orphan works,  Aletheia offers the work under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence until such time as the existing rights become clear and to continue to host the article would breach these rights. Despite having an identity management system, discussed later, it is clear that under the above system it is possible for someone to submit work in violation of existing rights. In a perfect world a system could be built with checks such that it is impossible for someone to upload work to a system like Aletheia illegally, allowing the content that Aletheia offers to never diminish. Indeed, this is one of the main points of a blockchain. Unfortunately this isn’t a perfect world and Aletheia needs to have a mechanism in place to remove content from the blockchain to avoid running afoul of legal action, or simply to remove content that doesn’t belong on the blockchain. Aletheia takes no responsibility for the actions of users, but will comply with takedown orders in the event the takedown order is found to be valid. In the event Aletheia receives a takedown order a notification will be sent to the community through the Aletheia client. A vote will be held on the veracity of the takedown order and if a quorum defined by the level of active users is achieved, a block will be added to the chain against the document preventing it from being shared. The document will be searchable by the client, however will no longer downloaded through the client. 

Instead, a document will be created and users will be asked through the client if they would like to host and seed this notice. The notice will appear in search results for that document and will be downloadable. It will  state who the take down request came from. In the event the content taken down was forced through the checks and was not a scientific article, the notice will state as such. If the take down request was not for rights violations, but for other reasons, such as the content contained personal information and by making it public this breeched the person’s privacy, for example, the notice will state as such. However, if the notice is for rights violation, the notice will state something yet to be decided upon but in the spirit of the below:

_Article [insert name here] has been removed from Aletheia as the Aletheia community has received a take down order from [insert name here] and found the order to be valid in its assertion that rights to the work have been violated._

_Scientific knowledge should be free for all though, and [insert name here] just deprived you of knowledge. What’s worse, [insert name here] did this legally. While Aletheia complies with the law, we don’t believe all laws are moral and some should be changed. Certain practices, like paywalls, stunt the growth of humanity simply to line the pockets of a select few. Did you know that [insert name here] posted a profit of [insert value here] in [insert year here]?_

_Laws that benefit very powerful vested interests will only be changed if pressure is bought to bare. Things you can do to help add to this pressure while remaining within the confines of the law:_

_Boycott paywalls of all kinds. Do not give them money, hit them where it hurts.
Call or write to your local, state and federal government representatives expressing that [insert name here] is operating in a legal but unethical manner, and the changing of laws that allow these immoral practices to occur legally is an important issue to you and your vote come election time.
Call or write to your local educational institutions and express that [insert name here] is operating in a legal but unethical manner, and the educational institution should join you in boycotting them. Suggest the educational institution source articles from open source journals and that this decision will be an important factor in deciding where your future tuition fees are invested.
Pitch news stories to your local media representatives about the legal but immoral practices [insert name here] engage in._

_You may be able to find the article you are looking for on websites such as Sci-Hub, this is simply a fact, much like saying water is wet, and we do not encourage you to find your article there. Piracy is illegal._

A notice like this adequately expresses Aletheia’s position while not breaching the law. In an effort to prevent abuse of articles being removed from searches of the blockchain, such as if an attacker submitted a take down order and then performed a majority attack on the subsequent vote, a vote can be held at any time to make the article downloadable again. If such a vote succeeds, another block would be added to the chain indicating the document is again searchable and downloadable.

At this stage it is not planned to introduce a method where the Aletheia blockchain could be forked, though it is recognised that unforeseen circumstances do arise. Should such a circumstance present itself, the question of forking would be put to the community as a vote.

## 7. Access and identity management
As identity is an integral part of Aletheia an identity management system is required. It’s important to note that your identity on Aletheia need not be connected to your real world identity if you so choose. Upon downloading the Aletheia client you will be asked to set up an account accessible by a username and password. The username and password will be encrypted and stored locally on the users device. It's a design principle of Aletheia to centrally hold and host as little information as possible, meaning a single server breach by attackers does not compromise the entire network, a single disaster or external act does not threaten the network, and as an entity Aletheia cannot hand over user records if subpoenaed because no records exist. A public and private PGP key pair will be generated with each account as well, which will also be encrypted and stored locally. This key will be used to prove that certain actions, such as the submission of documents or the auditing of source code was conducted from a particular account.

Should you wish to peer review documents you can have your qualifications verified. Much as a user upload scientific articles, a user can submit scanned copies of any qualification, such as a degree from a university, and sign the documents with the private PGP key unique to the user’s account. These documents are associated with that specific account, hosted and seeded by the user and anyone on the network can download and view the qualifications. To become accepted as a peer reviewer your qualifications will need to be established as legitimate. This will involved either paid staff or skilled volunteers making contact with the educational institution the qualifications come from to establish they indeed issued the qualifications to the person the user claims to be. As a one time only, you will need to submit a photographic identity document that can be seen by the user conducting the verification and at the end of the review process the identity document will be purged from the system. As at this stage only metadata is permanently stored to the blockchain the identity document can be purges. Should Aletheia move to storing content on the blockchain in future, the identity document would be submitted some other way. Please note that the qualification is not purged, it remains on record and viewable, so becoming a peer reviewer ties the users Aletheia account to their real identity, something to bear in mind. The reviewer will countersign the qualification with their own private PGP key, and the user's client will update, granting them the ability to see articles submitted for peer review.

## 8. Community
Aletheia is the embodiment of software that, while it exists as code, it does not function in any real sense out of human context. Aletheia’s skeleton may be a blockchain, but it’s heart is the human community. Anyone, by downloading the Aletheia client and setting up a profile, can be a member of the community and through the client the user will be able to see all the activities they can take part in as a member of the community. 

Below is a basic guide to the common community activities:

* Peer review documents – Users that have their qualifications verified are able to see documents pending peer review. They will be able to download the documents and send them back to the submitter to assess their feedback.

* Vet peer reviewers – look over submitted identity documents to ensure the user has the qualification they claim.

* Localise documents – translate documents into other languages and then host and seed the document which will be linked to the original, making Aletheia’s content more accessible to a wider audience.

* Host and seed documents – all users will see a list of suggested documents with low seed counts that they can download and seed. This strengthens Aletheia as a global network.

* Vet the metadata submitted with articles and datasets – improve the metadata quality to improve search results for articles through the Aletheia client.

* Participate in votes – decisions that smart contracts cannot handle themselves are given over to the global community to vote on. For a vote to pass a quorum must be reached, determined by the number of active users. Often the topic being voted upon is not black and white and discussions need to be held. Clicking on the vote notification in the client will bring up a screen asking you for your vote along with providing a link to a forum were discussions can be held. It's envisaged the most common vote will be for content to be indexed to the blockchain, but other votes such as on the legitimacy of take down orders will also be held. The length of a vote, five consecutive days, cannot be changed. However, in a situation where new information comes to light and more time is required for deliberation before a vote is decided, the originator of the vote can cancel the initial vote and restart the vote at a later time. Similarly the size of the required quorum for a vote to pass cannot be changed and is worked out at the time the vote is established by the number of active users. Should there be a drastic drop in the number of users for whatever reason and the quorum simply cannot be reached, the vote can be cancelled by the originator and restarted with a new quorum taking into account the current users. To prevent votes simply being reset because the originator doesn't like the perceived outcome, the results of the vote cannot be seen until after the vote has ended. All users can see is the number of users who have voted, not which way they have voted.

* Participate in online forums – Not all votes are simple and many will need to be discussed in an online forum. In the same spirit as a blockchain, forum posts cannot be edited. Every twenty four hours the forum generates a document containing text of new threads and posts created in the last twenty four hours, this document is added to the blockchain as per a scientific article without any vetting process, and people are encouraged to host and seed the document. Should the website hosting the forum ever be attacked or taken down for any reason, a distributed copy exists to recreate the forum.

* Audit source code – by auditing source code, signing the section of code along with the auditor's comments with their PGP private key and hosting and seeding the generated audit document users can contribute to the security of Aletheia.

## 9. Reputation system
The often cited reason existing open source journals don't grow to rival their paywall counterparts is due to the prestige that comes with being published in a large, well established paywall journal. For academics it is often more beneficial for their careers to publish in a large paywall journal [5](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/09/nobel-winner-boycott-science-journals). Aletheia can do nothing about the prestige academics get for publishing in paywall journals other than to work to inform people about the negative aspects of paywall journals, but Aletheia can attempt to emulate this prestige to encourage submissions. Interacting with the community and contributing to Aletheia will gain reputation, a record of which is stored on an immutable blockchain. Anything from hosting and seeding documents to participating in votes and peer reviews will gain a user reputation in that field with an aggregated overall reputation score. Given all the tasks required to generate reputation along with the checks built into many of the processes, plus the trusted nature of the blockchain over a mundane website it is hoped that Aletheia reputation could come to mean something outside of Aletheia. To make the reputation system more than just numbers inside of Aletheia, the higher the user's reputation the more weight their vote carries. To prevent an adversary obtaining a large amount of reputation for the purpose of influencing votes, such as hosting and seeding a large number of documents already indexed to the blockchain, the weight of votes will be calculated by assessing reputation in all areas and screening out extreme outlyers. A normal user will more than likely participate in multiple activities on Aletheia, even if this is just voting and participating in the forums, but this means there is no immediate way for an attacker to gain a large amount of reputation for little effort. Similarly a user can download multiple clients to attempt to gain multiple votes, but the votes will carry little weight without reputation. Such an attacker could gain reputation by performing tasks across a number of clients, but the collective reputation will be the same as if they had performed these actions from the one client with the one 'heavier' vote rather than multiple 'lighter' votes.

## 10. Code audit
Linus's Law and the Many Eyes Theory suggest that bugs in open source software should be shallow due to the number of eyes looking at the code [6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus's_Law), [7](http://blog.erratasec.com/2014/09/many-eyes-theory-conclusively-disproven.html). However, discoveries of vulnerabilities like Shellshock in open source code that has been available for people to look at for roughly twenty five years calls these theories into question. In current open source projects it's not often easy to see how much of the code has actually been audited and therefore it's very easy for some to make the sweeping statement 'the code is open source so it must have very few to no bugs'. Aletheia attempts to shine a light on code auditing. Anyone can view the source code for Aletheia and therefore anyone can audit the code. Users can create a document with sections of source code they have audited along with notes of conditions if met the code will be secure under etc., and sign this document with their private PGP key. This document can then be hosted and seeded, and the weight of the audit can be verified by the reputation of the user. Based on this data Aletheia can show all users exactly how much of the code base has been audited, by which users, by how many users and how much weight should be placed in the audit. 

To encourage code audits, users can become certified auditors much the same way users are vetted to become peer reviewers. If the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment on successful completion of the task once the community verifies by a vote that the audit is legitimate.

## 11. Smart contracts
The mechanism that Aletheia handles votes and other decisions is through smart contracts. These smart contracts can be broadly thought of in two categories, votes related to the blockchain and management of Aletheia. 

Smart contracts handling votes related to the blockchain:

* Acceptance to be indexed onto the blockchain – should the metadata of the article and dataset be searchable by the Aletheia client.

* Confirmation that a peer review was legitimate – after the article is indexed on the blockchain a vote will be held to assess the peer review to ensure it actually took place and that it is sufficient. If the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment if the vote is carried.

* Confirmation that a code audit was legitimate – on the hosting and seeding of a code audit document by a certified user a vote will be held to ensure the audit is legitimate. If the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment if the vote is carried. 

* Disagreement with acceptance to be indexed by the blockchain – If something that is not a scientific article or dataset makes it past the previous check a vote can be held to make it unsearchable by the client, thereby removing it from circulation through Aletheia.

* Vetting localisation – for a translated document be accepted onto the blockchain it will need to be approved  by someone who affirms they also speak this language. There will be a list of languages that users can click on to drill down into the pending translations and the approver will sign the document with their pgp key asserting the translation is of good quality. 

* Superseded/incorrect information – should an article be found to be partially or wholly factually incorrect, possibly due to an advancement in scientific understanding or any other means, a vote can be held to add a notation to the article stating as such.

* Disagreement with a translation – should a user feel a translated document is of poor quality or completely incorrect, a vote can be launched to remove the document from the blockchain. In this instance vote with a  quorum will be set based off the number of active users submitting translations.

* Disagreement with vetting of users – should a user have reason to believe a previously accepted peer reviewer does not hold or no longer holds the qualifications that allowed them to become a peer reviewer, a vote can be held to revoke the user's access to the peer review queue.

* Acceptance of legitimacy of a takedown order – If Aletheia receives takedown orders, to ensure the order is legitimate the order will be made available to all users to look at. Assessment of the order is a simple series of questions, does Aletheia host the document the order pertains to and was the order issued by a party that legitimately holds the rights to that document.

* Disagreement with a previously accepted takedown order – if information comes to light that a takedown order was spurious, or if the party who issued the takedown order no longer holds the rights to the document, a vote can be held to make the document downloadable once again.

Smart contracts handling the management of Aletheia:

* Hiring paid staff or skilled volunteers – users can fill out a form listing all their skills and previous work experience. The form will be accessible by other users and people can endorse one another if they have worked together previously. Based on the quality of the candidate worked out by possessed skills, length of previous work experience and endorsements rated by the reputation of the endorser, the contract will offer a paid position to the best candidate as and when roles become available or workload demands an increase in headcount.

* Maintenance of the platform – users will have the ability to make bug reports through the client. These bugs will be routed to a pool of paid staff or skilled volunteers with the required technical skills. Based on a match of the bug to skill with workload taken into consideration the bug will be assigned to one or more appropriate users who will see the bug report in their client. The contract will keep track of assigned work to be able to assess workload. If the user is not receiving a wage from Aletheia a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as payment on successful completion of the task once the community verifies the bug is indeed fixed. This considered external work as the request originated from Aletheia's community, not within the entity of Aletheia itself.

* Vote to verify bug was fixed – avoids bugs being simply marked as completed without being addressed.

* Development of the platform – as per maintenance of the platform, being feature requests rather than bug reports. This is considered external work.

* Vote to verify feature is now available – as per vote to verify bug fixed, being a feature request instead of a bug report.

* Allocation of internal work – any user who is a paid staff member or skilled volunteer of Aletheia can submit a work request noting down the team the work is required from. Perhaps their team needs to do something, so the work request is submitted knowing it will come back to them simply so the contract has a record of the workload. Or perhaps a team needs something from another team before they can press on with a task, they can submit a work request that will be routed to the required team. The contract will allocate to members of the team with the best skills/most capacity. This workload allocation prevents the need of positions purely devoted to workload management of direct reports. This type of work is considered internal work, which needs a vote to sign off on completion from internal paid staff/skilled volunteers but not the wider community.

* Other requirements of the platform – as per maintenance of the platform, but is a catch all contract for things like legal advice, graphic design etc.

* Payroll – at a regular interval the contract will check how much work has been completed by each staff member/skilled volunteer taking into account the difficulty of the work and a portion of any available funds will be routed to the user as a regular wage along with an adjusted amount based on work signed off as completed by internal vote taking into account difficulty. 

* Budget – at a regular interval the contract will check how much money is available to the Aletheia entity. It will publish this information to the blockchain along with expenses accrued during that period such as wages of staff and payments to skilled volunteers. At the end of each year the system will publish a projection for the coming year based off data from the last year/s.

* Catch-all contract – smart contracts are meant to facilitate work, not dictate it and sometimes computer code just doesn't cover a real world situation. Rather than the normal five day period, as this contract may be invoked in the instance of an emergency and the vote will expire once all active staff/skilled volunteers have voted and to pass the vote must be unanimous. Any staff member/skilled volunteer can call a vote on whatever the issue happens to be. If the vote passes its agreed work will be carried out contrary to/outside of the scope of existing contracts until that particular subject is addressed. This could be used by staff/skilled volunteers to take executive action in the event enough users believes an issue threatens the existence of Aletheia itself for example. There is potential for abuse in such a contract, however the entire workforce would need to collude to use this contract maliciously, being a high bar of difficulty. It's also worth mentioning that contracts are largely just directives that people can choose to obey and ignore, so any contract could be ignored or action could be taken at any time that contradicts a contract, much as people can choose to follow or ignore etiquette rules posted in the office kitchen. Risk is not unique to this contract.

Every smart contract, along with every time it is invoked and the outcome of the execution of the smart contract is stored on the blockchain to provide a fully transparent audit trail.

## 12. Revenue model
Ideally the human race would be a post scarcity society and individuals wouldn't need monetary incentive because they don't have expenses in their lives. Unfortunately we are not there yet, and while many in the open source community will disagree with this decision, Aletheia as an entity is envisaged as a for profit company. This purely for pragmatic reasons, the scope of Aletheia is quite large and the likelihood a prototype will be built and maintained by people volunteering their time is small. The likelihood a prototype will be built and maintained by people being paid for their time is higher. Aletheia will accept charitable donations and will generate revenue through advertising. 

Again, looking at Aletheia pragmatically there is a compelling argument to solve some of the problems in advertising. Currently, advertising is seen as a shady business based around generating profiles of people without their knowledge, violating their privacy that can be used to market to users better, sold onto other companies or stored for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to subpoena as and when they desire [8](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/yahoo-wants-to-patent-billboards-that-spy-on-the-public-for-targeted-ads/). Advertising also has many other problems. Billboards are expensive and often the return on investment is hard to see [9](http://www.relevance.com/is-billboard-advertising-effective-in-2015/), newspapers are in decline [10](https://web.archive.org/web/20090320033032/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003951616), video killed the radio star [11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Killed_the_Radio_Star), broadcast television has shrinking rates due to the rise of the Internet [12](http://www.techradar.com/news/television/is-broadcast-tv-toast-1295801) and online advertisements are threatened by ad blockers [13](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/ad-blocking-software-is-on-the-rise-2015-2?r=US&IR=T). As long as the Internet is viewed through a web browser that is built to have add-ons written for it and installable in a few clicks, there will always be ad blockers. As malvertising, the practice of spreading malware through ad networks, continues to rise [14](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/25/malvertising-on-the-rise-as-cybercriminals-use-int/), so will ad blockers as security mechanisms. Aletheia attempts to address these issues.

Aletheia collects no information on its users, so Aletheia will offer a number of different versions of the client, each with an age bracket and the user self selects which client they want. This way, the user can have ads that may appeal to them in complete anonymity, and they can even pick a client in an age bracket they don't belong to if they want to to further disguise their details. Aletheia will be able to report download statistics to perspective buyers to prove the size of the audience. Almost every country on Earth has laws stating children must be educated to a certain age and levels of tertiary education will continue to raise as the middle class continue to expand in developing countries [15](http://oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/3681/An_emerging_middle_class.html). It is developing countries at largely rely on pirated scientific articles due to the fact their education institutions cannot afford to pay for exorbitant paywall journals [16](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone). Aletheia will have a large audience unbounded by geography, race, gender, nationality or age. The Aletheia client also exists independent of a webbrowser, meaning ads cannot be blocked in Aletheia with current browser based ad blocking technology. In short, Aletheia sets the standard in ethical advertising that doesn't track ad recipients and has access to many eyes across the world with ads that cannot be blocked. 

For advertising, Aletheia plans to use a method similar to Wikipedia. When you search for something online, Wikipedia results often appear. Wikipedia does not advertise and relies solely on search engine results. Aletheia will run a website that hosts scientific journal titles that can be web crawled and indexed into search engines. When Aletheia's website appears in a search result and is clicked in it will prompt the user to log into Aletheia or direct them to a landing page were they can download a version of the client.

## 13. Why blockchain?
Aletheia does not use all the properties of a blockchain, and the idea at it's heart is simply a database. The reason a blockchain is used is primarily for its resiliency. Blockchains are resistant to tampering, meaning the information stored in a blockchain is safer than in a traditional database. Blockchains are also decentralised, meaning that anyone with the open source Aletheia client, which can be downloaded from the official website or any other place that chooses to host it, is running part of the blockchain ledger which is constantly syncing with other users to form the whole ledger. Aletheia threatens very powerful, entrenched and wealthy interests and it is expected the network could come under pressure in one way, shape or form. By using a blockchain, to take Aletheia offline an attacker would have to remove clients from a critical mass of users, or simply take a critical mass of users off the Internet, users that reside all across the world in various legal jurisdictions. Such a task is inordinately more difficult than attacking a central server.

## 14. Out of scope but desirable
This whitepaper only covers the basics of Aletheia such that a working prototype can be built. There are plenty of other functions Aletheia could have so people are encouraged to participate in discussion around this project. One future feature would be a mechanism to assist researchers analyse large numbers of journals to look at publishing trends and the like in an effort to improve the publishing ecosystem. Another would be the functionality to mass download every indexed and seeded document quickly and efficiently without having to search every individual article and dataset. This final feature forms a fail-safe to Aletheia's library and allows anyone to host the documents on their own service.

## 15. Outlook on blockchain and science
In the course of completing this whitepaper differing opinions in the scientific community on blockchain have become apparent, particularly around the peer review process. Some camps espouse a human actioned/blockchain facilitated peer review process as outlined in this paper. Others say that humans should be eliminated from the peer review process and through semantics, making human written text machine readable, a computer should check the facts in a scientific article against other submitted articles, thereby performing a ‘machine review’. Still others say that humans should be removed even from the collection of scientific fact, with large and complex Internet of Things networks generating data that can be fed into a universal 'blockchain of absolute truth'. Any misunderstanding or misrepresentation of these latter two positions is entirely unintended. This paper outlines the first of these three schools of thought, believing that perfection should not become the enemy of good. If Aletheia is successful it will certainly bring projects of the other two camps closer to realisation, so it is hoped that everyone with an interest in blockchain and/or science can support a project like Aletheia.
